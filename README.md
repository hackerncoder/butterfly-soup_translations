# Butterfly Soup Translations
Unofficial Butterfly Soup translations made by fans.

---

### I want to help! What do i do?
Thanks!  
The easiest way to get started is by using [weblate](https://littleroot.net/weblate/projects/butterfly-soup/translations/), you need an account to create new languages and to save a translation, otherwise you can only make suggestions (that then need to be accepted by someone with an account)

Otherwise, check the satus of the language you want to translate, if it is in progress see the linked issue, else create an issue with what language you want to translate into and I will get back to you as soon as possible with the files.


### Status of languages
In Progress:
* Spanish: [#1](https://github.com/hackerncoder/butterfly-soup_translations/issues/1)
* Tamil: [#3](https://github.com/hackerncoder/butterfly-soup_translations/issues/3)
* French: [#4](https://github.com/hackerncoder/butterfly-soup_translations/issues/4)

### Can I just get the translation files?
Sure, they are in translations/general. (see [this comment](https://github.com/hackerncoder/butterfly-soup_translations/issues/4#issuecomment-789272431) on how it works)
